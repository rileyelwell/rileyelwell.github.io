                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Riley Elwell, and I am a game designer passionate about level design, interacting systems, and original mechanics. While I love RPGs, action-adventure, and 
                    story-driven games, I enjoy prototyping new ideas for all genres. I aspire to be a game designer working in the industry and have goals of bringing 
                    fresh ideas surrounding community, diversity, and reflection to my creations.

                    I am currently attending Futuregames in Stockholm to study game design, with an expectation to graduate in 2026.
                </p>

                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in California all the way up to the end of high school, where I first discovered coding. I immediately realized that this was a path I 
                    wanted to pursue, so I joined my school's robotics program and cybersecurity team. My final year of high school afforded me the opportunity to 
                    create my first game with a friend. It was a humble text-based adventure game created in Python, but the experience we crafted for others to enjoy 
                    filled me with excitement and motivation for the future.                   
                </p>
                <p>   
                    After high school, I attended Oregon State University, where I graduated with a B.S. in Applied Computer Science (Simulation & Game Programming). 
                    Here, I was able to use my technical skills to craft content reminiscent of games I deeply cherished, such as Minecraft, Firewatch, and Outer Wilds. 
                    By majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Simulation and Game Programming, I established a strong foundation for my programming 
                    skills while exploring my true passion of game development. I completed courses that covered diverse topics like 3D graphics, shaders, animation, 
                    game programming, and more, all of which contributed to the growth of my skillset. Simultaneously, in my spare time, I explored the Unity game 
                    engine, creating smaller games and experimenting with various ideas.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    After graduating college in the United States, I was accepted into a game design program in Stockholm, Sweden, called Futuregames. I decided that more 
                    dedicated experience with game design would be necessary before trying to enter the job market. I am thrilled to have the chance to move to Sweden to 
                    begin my next journey, where I hope to build a robust portfolio, make connections with other students, and continue my growth under knowledgeable mentors.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse inspired me to explore animation and embrace my artistic passions. Its sequel, 
                        Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, is currently my favorite movie. My portfolio's color scheme is based on Miles Morales' story.

                    <li>I've been playing soccer (or "football") since I was five, and I am an avid Chelsea FC supporter (but realistic).</li>
                    <li>Fallout: New Vegas is my favorite video game, but Minecraft and Pokemon are my favorites from my childhood.</li>
                    <li>I was a member of the Oregon State Esports Club for two years, where I played Rocket League. My peak rank was Grand Champ 1.</li>
                    <li>I competed in VEX Robotics for four years in high school, qualifying for and attending the Worlds Competition in Louisville, Kentcuky (2019).</li>
