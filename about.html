                <h1>Hello!</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Riley Elwell. I am in my final year of undergraduate studies, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Oregon State University. 
                    With a desire to improve my existing skill set, participate in valuable experiences under distinguished professors, and establish connections with 
                    mentors and industry organizations, I am currently applying for graduate programs in game design and development. As an avid game enthusiast and developer, 
                    I hope to achieve my goal of contributing to the gaming industry with my ideas of community, diversity, and reflection, all working together to enhance the 
                    overall player experience.
                </p>

                <h1>My Background</h1>
                <p>
                    From my high school days, I discovered the world of coding and immediately realized that it was the path I wanted to pursue in the future. During that time, 
                    I participated in my school's robotics program and cybersecurity team, and I developed a strong passion for creating interactive media using technology. I 
                    can vividly recall the thrill of coding my very first game alongside a friend, pouring hours into refining its every feature. It was a humble text-based 
                    adventure game created in Python, but the notion that I could craft an experience for others to enjoy filled me with excitement and motivation.
                    
                </p>
                <p>   
                    Upon enrolling at Oregon State University, I realized I had an opportunity to use my technical skills to craft content reminiscent of the games I deeply 
                    cherished, such as Minecraft, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Outer Wilds. Although the university didn't offer a dedicated "Game Design" program, I chose to 
                    major in Computer Science as the foundation for my coding skills while specializing in "Simulation and Game Programming." This allowed me to enroll in 
                    courses that covered diverse topics like 3D graphics, shaders, animation, game programming, and more, all of which contributed to the growth of my skillset. 
                    Simultaneously, in my spare time, I explored the Unity game engine, creating smaller games and experimenting with various aspects of game development.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    This journey has brought me to where I stand today, filled with a deeper passion for game design and development than I've ever known. I'm dedicated to 
                    honing my skills, committed to enhancing my prospects of breaking into the enigmatic world of the gaming industry. My aspiration is to become a game 
                    designer and developer who collaborates with gifted individuals, crafting games that captivate and inspire both myself and others, leaving us eager 
                    to dive into the worlds we create. 
                </p>
