                <h1>Hello!</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Riley Elwell and I am a game developer who is passionate about a game's design, systems, and mechanics. While I love 
                    RPGs, action-adventure, and story-driven games, I enjoy prototyping new ideas for all genres. I apsire to be a game designer working in the industry and 
                    have goals of bringing fresh ideas surrounding community, diversity, and relfection to my creations.

                    I will be attending Futuregames Stockholm in the Fall to study game design for the next two and a half years. I'm looking forward to expanding my skills, learning 
                    from experienced professionals, and connecting with mentors and industry leaders. My goal is to bring fresh ideas around community, diversity, and reflection to 
                    the gaming world, creating games that truly enhance the player experience.
                </p>

                <h1>My Background</h1>
                <p>
                    I grew up in California all of the way up to the end of high school, where I first discovered coding in general. I immediately realized that this was a
                    path I wanted to pursue, so I joined my school's robotics program and cybersecurity team. My final year of high school afforded me an opportunity to create my 
                    first game with a friend. It was a humble text-based adventure game created in Python, but the experience we crafted for others to enjoy filled me with excitement 
                    and motivation for the future.                   
                </p>
                <p>   
                    After high school, I attended Oregon State University, where I graduated with a B.S. in Applied Computer Science (Simulation & Game Programming). Here I was able
                    to use my technical skills to craft content reminiscent of games I deeply cherished, such as Minecraft, Firewatch, and Outer Wilds. By majoring in Computer 
                    Science with a specialization in Simulation and Game Programming, I established a strong foundation for my programming skills while exploring my true passion 
                    of game development. I completed courses that covered diverse topics like 3D graphics, shaders, animation, game programming, and more, all of which contributed 
                    to the growth of my skillset. Simultaneously, in my spare time, I explored the Unity game engine, creating smaller games and experimenting with various ideas.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    After college in the United States, I was accepted to study in a game development program in Stockholm, Sweden called Futuregames. I decided that a couple more 
                    years of tailored experience with game development would be necessary before trying to enter the market. I am thrilled to have the chance to move to Sweden
                    in Fall 2024 to begin my next journey where I hope to build a robust portfolio, make connections with other students, and continue my growth under knowledgeable mentors.
                </p>
