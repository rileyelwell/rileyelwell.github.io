                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>
                    Embark on a heartwarming animated journey with a four-legged hero, a Shiba Inu, as he ventures through an 
                    enchanting torii gate. In this whimsical short story, he delves into a world of nostalgia, seeking to 
                    relive precious moments with his departed owner. Amidst the tapestry of emotions, from the pangs of grief to the 
                    confounding maze of confusion, our furry protagonist discovers a serene refuge in the comforting embrace of 
                    cherished memories. This tale unfolds with a perfect blend of heartfelt emotions and the magic that lies beyond 
                    the torii gate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my final project in the Computer Animation course at Oregon State University, I undertook the challenge 
                    of crafting a three-minute animated short story. The objective was to seamlessly blend the principles 
                    of animation with innovative concepts unearthed through our individual research pursuits. Fascinated by the prospect 
                    of pushing creative boundaries, I opted to delve into the realm of environmental animation. My focus centered on 
                    developing techniques for diverse special effects, including the intricacies of rain, wind, fire, and other 
                    particle systems. The narrative and aesthetic inspiration for this project sprang from the immersive world of the 
                    video game Ghostwire Tokyo. The visual stylings, including graphics and shading, were influenced by the artistic 
                    brilliance of anime masterpieces such as Studio Ghibli's The Wind Rises and Cyberpunk Edgerunners.

                <h1>My Role & The Process</h1>
                <p style="white-space: pre-line"> Project Type: Academic, Solo
                    Role: Designer, Animator
                    Software: Blender
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project, I navigated the interface of Blender, serving as the sole architect of the project. My 
                    responsibilities encompassed the modeling of assets, incorporating a mix of original creations and freely available 
                    online resources (referenced in my video's description). I crafted the narrative, sculpted the 3D environment, and 
                    brought characters and particle systems to life through animation. Executed over a span of approximately two weeks, 
                    this project harnessed the power of online research to enhance its creative arsenal. To illuminate the intricacies 
                    of my Blender methodology, I'll delve into the primary enhancements introduced in this animated creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the rain simulation, I created a low-poly raindrop, elongated it using proportional editing, and applied it to 
                    a particle system with motion blur for a choppy appearance. Adding a cel shader enhanced the desolation, aligning 
                    with the scene's dark theme. A unique technique involved initiating particle spawning at a negative frame number for 
                    a realistic raindrop descent. Implementing the toon/cel shader, I used a ColorRamp in a mix node for object colors, 
                    added shading, and outlined with a separate material. The campfire, animated with a displace modifier, featured 
                    stylized colors using gradient and magic textures. A point light intensified the illumination, and small fire 
                    particles added realism. Adjusting gravity and field weight settings fine-tuned the overall effect. Stylized grass 
                    evolved into a hair particle system on a plane with a texture for a painted look. Blade thickness varied with wind 
                    intensity, and flowers were seamlessly integrated. Scenes with the torii gate included fog crafted with a volume 
                    scatter node in a default cube for a mystique effect. Lampposts emitted light within the fog, and a strategically 
                    placed area light of diffused illumination, contributing to the atmospheric ambiance.
                </p>

                <h1>What I Learned & What I Would Improve</h1>
                <p>
                    This project has been a profound learning experience for me, providing extensive insights into the intricacies of 
                    3D animation and the key principles that captivate audiences. Through hands-on experimentation with particle systems,
                    I gained skills in special effects techniques, uncovering Blender's capacity to integrate NPR styles within a 3D 
                    framework. Navigating the Blender interface throughout this project and the course has equipped me with an in-depth 
                    understanding of its functions and capabilities, allowing me to explore its full potential. Delving into the 
                    process of animation creation, from storyboarding to design, modeling, animation, and video editing, has underscored 
                    the importance of a holistic approach to the craft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary challenge I encountered in this project revolved around the initial storyboard and design phase. 
                    Inadequate planning resulted in multiple restarts and moments of uncertainty regarding the project's vision. 
                    Moving forward, I recognize the need for a more structured approach to enhance efficiency and clarity. Another 
                    area for improvement lies in the use of more intricate models of my own creation, featuring enhanced armatures for 
                    smoother animations. The absence of detailed bone structures in the characters hindered the conveyance of motion to 
                    the audience, prompting a reconsideration of model complexity. To elevate the visual appeal, I acknowledge the 
                    importance of dedicating additional time to refining the lighting in each scene, particularly those set at night. 
                    While the cel shader added a decent aesthetic, a more deliberate approach to lighting would have showcased its 
                    potential more effectively. Going forward, I plan to invest more time in perfecting the lighting nuances to 
                    accentuate the desired visual atmosphere.
