                <p>
                    Hello, everyone! Welcome to my very first blog post. I've created this space to share my thoughts and experiences from time to time. While it primarily 
                    serves as a personal journal for me to revisit, I hope it might also pique your interest. For this initial entry, I'll keep it short and sweet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently immersed in the world of 3D animation with Blender as part of my animation course. My project revolves around the idea of penguins playing 
                    soccer. To kick things off, I began by sculpting a penguin character, using YouTube tutorials to grasp essential techniques and navigate the Blender 
                    interface. As I progress, I'm increasingly aware of the challenges that 3D modeling and animation pose, but I must admit, I've found immense enjoyment 
                    in the entire process. Looking ahead, my next personal prroject will be to craft a realistic 3D environment with a focus on high-quality models, topology, and 
                    captivating lighting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In recent developments, my teammates and I have been diligently planning our capstone project over the past couple of weeks. Our ambitious endeavor involves 
                    the design and development of a vehicle simulator. I'm brimming with excitement at the prospect of diving into Unreal Engine 5, and my aim is to master the 
                    intricacies of game engine physics, lighting, and processes. While we have a preliminary concept for our implementation, our initial focus will be on 
                    constructing the drivable vehicles, a task that will demand some time and dedication. This gives us ample room to brainstorm and refine our approach in the 
                    coming months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I'd like to mention that I'm in the process of crafting a plan to participate in a game jam as soon as possible. I want to experience the conditions 
                    of a short development period, but also practice these important skills with a team. I have a couple of people in mind, as well as ideas for a game to get 
                    started, so fingers crossed the plan goes accordingly!
                </p>

                <h1>12/26/2023</h1>
                <p>
                    Happy holidays, everyone! I wanted to provide a quick update on my recent activities over the past month. I 
                    successfully completed my Fall quarter at school, returned home for the holidays, and took part in an exciting 
                    game jam!
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the final weeks of the school term, I focused on completing an animation final project for one of my courses. 
                    This project, based on a shiba and its owner, involved extensive research and experimentation with special effects 
                    and particle systems. The result is a three-minute short animated story, marking my first substantial animation 
                    project. I'm proud of the final product and the learning journey it entailed. If you're interested in more details, 
                    you can find them <a href="shiba.html">here.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After finishing the school term, I decided to participate in the Jame Gam Christmas Edition game jam hosted on 
                    itch.io. Serving as the sole designer and developer, I used Unity and Aseprite to create a 2D present stacking 
                    game where players control an elf. Despite the time constraint of one week, I'm pleased with the outcome. 
                    If you're curious, additional details can be found <a href="present-plunge.html">here.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I'm excited about my upcoming internship with Inorganic Games, set to kick off in January. 
                    We've already held several meetings and planned tasks for the future. I'm eager to collaborate with a talented 
                    team to design and develop a game. Additionally, the anticipation for Spring 2024 is building, as that's when 
                    the game we're working on will be released for WebGL and Mobile platforms!
                </p>

                    Hello, everyone! Unfortunately, I've fallen behind on my goal of blogging monthly, primarily due to focusing on my capstone project and internship 
                    responsibilities. However, I'm excited to share that my capstone team has made substantial progress, and my internship is nearing its end.
                </p>

                    As the Winter term draws to a close, I'm down to just one quarter before I receive my Bachelor's degree from Oregon State University. I'm thrilled to have 
                    chosen this institution for its outstanding education and the multitude of academic and professional connections it offers. Throughout my classes this term, 
                    I've honed my skills in modeling, computer graphics, texturing, and shading. While my primary career goal remains game design, I've found it extremely 
                    beneficial to gain an understanding of all aspects of game development. Besides, I thoroughly enjoy the creative process of crafting artistic elements!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My internship at Inorganic Games has been a valuable learning experience, marking the first time I've collaborated with a full team of specialists on a game 
                    project. I've been responsible for designing and prototyping various armors and abilities for the player in the game "Writhe." This role primarily involves 
                    shaping the mechanics of the game, reaffirming my preference for technical game design within the field of game development. In addition to my individual 
                    contributions, I've found it refreshing to engage in brainstorming sessions and bounce ideas off my colleagues during meetings. Witnessing the impressive 
                    work produced by my talented teammates has been both inspiring and motivating as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe it's important to mention that I've also been in the process of applying for Futuregames in Sweden, a renowned game development school. My goal is 
                    to enhance my current programming and design skills by having the guidance of mentors, engaging in collaborative game projects, and learning from other 
                    talented individuals. Futuregames has an excellent reputation and offers a program with classes that I believe will greatly benefit me (specifically game design).

                    I've been revising my current documents detailing my experiences and working on additional work samples to finalize my application before submission. I'm 
                    particularly eager for April when I should find out whether or not I've been accepted. The next couple of months are shaping up to be very busy but also 
                    exciting for me. I hope to update this website with more information as soon as possible!
