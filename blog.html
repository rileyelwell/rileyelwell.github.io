                    Hello, everyone! Welcome to my very first blog post. I've created this space to share my thoughts and experiences from time to time. While it primarily 
                    serves as a personal journal for me to revisit, I hope it might also pique your interest. For this initial entry, I'll keep it short and sweet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently immersed in the world of 3D animation with Blender as part of my animation course. My project revolves around the idea of penguins playing 
                    soccer. To kick things off, I began by sculpting a penguin character, using YouTube tutorials to grasp essential techniques and navigate the Blender 
                    interface. As I progress, I'm increasingly aware of the challenges that 3D modeling and animation pose, but I must admit, I've found immense enjoyment 
                    in the entire process. Looking ahead, my next personal prroject will be to craft a realistic 3D environment with a focus on high-quality models, topology, and 
                    captivating lighting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In recent developments, my teammates and I have been diligently planning our capstone project over the past couple of weeks. Our ambitious endeavor involves 
                    the design and development of a vehicle simulator. I'm brimming with excitement at the prospect of diving into Unreal Engine 5, and my aim is to master the 
                    intricacies of game engine physics, lighting, and processes. While we have a preliminary concept for our implementation, our initial focus will be on 
                    constructing the drivable vehicles, a task that will demand some time and dedication. This gives us ample room to brainstorm and refine our approach in the 
                    coming months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I'd like to mention that I'm in the process of crafting a plan to participate in a game jam as soon as possible. I want to experience the conditions 
                    of a short development period, but also practice these important skills with a team. I have a couple of people in mind, as well as ideas for a game to get 
                    started, so fingers crossed the plan goes accordingly!
