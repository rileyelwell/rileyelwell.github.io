                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>
                    Every festive season, Santa embarks on his global sleigh journey, spreading holiday cheer by delivering presents 
                    to homes. Who can blame him for dropping a couple along the way? Besides, that's what elves are for! Step into the 
                    jolly shoes of one of Santa's little helpers and catch the presents that fall from his sleigh. But beware of the 
                    dangerous anvils plummeting from above! Make sure to be on your best behavior as you try to earn Santa's special 
                    rewards for swift grabs and impressive catches. Best of luck on this merry mission!
                </p>

                <h1>My Role & The Process</h1>
                <p style="white-space: pre-line"> Project Type: Game Jam (itch.io), Solo
                    Project Role: Designer, Programmer, Artist
                    Software: Unity, Aseprite
                    Languages: C#
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this game jam, the designated theme was Christmas, and the unique gameplay element, a major focus, was an anvil. 
                    My initial concept centered around stacking presents, with the anvil serving as a disruptor to heighten the game's 
                    difficulty. Given the Christmas theme, I envisioned an elf catching and stacking presents falling from the sky or 
                    Santa's sleigh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of implementation, I began by ensuring that presents, anvils, and the player each had the necessary 
                    colliders, rigidbody components, tags, and collision layers. Leveraging these elements, I could discern whether a present 
                    was falling, part of the stack, or the topmost present. This allowed for the dynamic adjustment of colliders and the 
                    manipulation of object positions and sorting layers to achieve the desired effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The spawning mechanism for presents and anvils relied on an InvokeRepeating call, employing an object pool to 
                    mitigate constant instantiation and destruction in the scene. All sprites, background elements, and UI components 
                    were crafted using Aseprite, including the animation for the player's feet. Notably, the game's control structure 
                    is facilitated by several singletons attached to empty game objects that I refer to as "managers." These encompass 
                    managers for gameplay, audio, object pooling, and object spawning.
                </p>

                <h1>What I Learned & What I Would Improve</h1>
                <p>
                    Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into efficiency and the art of designing 
                    a game within specified parameters. Given the game jam's objective of creating a game within a limited timeframe, 
                    I quickly realized the importance of clearly defining my goals and identifying ambitious ideas as stretch goals. 
                    While I wasn't able to implement all of my stretch goals by the submission deadline, this process allowed me to 
                    hone my skills in pixel art sprite creation, which constituted a significant portion of the game's assets. I devoted 
                    considerable time to enhancing the aesthetics of the UI elements, strategically considering their placement relative 
                    to the user. Despite the challenges and time constraints, this experience improved my understanding of effective game
                    design and provided valuable insights into prioritization and decision-making in the creative process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, several ideas on my list were impractical given the limited time available in the game jam. 
                    One such idea involved implementing an upgrade and level system, enabling users to modify gameplay aspects over time
                    (e.g., faster movement, jumping, dash mechanics, temporary invincibility). Another consideration was the introduction
                    of different power-ups, like presents that grant extra lives or anvils that move both vertically and horizontally 
                    to increase difficulty. To enhance the gameplay's dynamism, I propose implementing a system for managing the present 
                    stack, requiring users to balance presents, especially as the stack height and movement speed increase. Additionally, 
                    a technical improvement would involve optimizing scene management and saving specific variables to ensure seamless 
                    audio transitions, such as background music, between scenes and overall performance enhancements.
