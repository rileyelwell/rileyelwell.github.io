                                    <p>Wanting to create a fun, <span class="keyword">online multiplayer co-op</span> experience with friends, we focused on two

                                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                                        <li>A challenge that requires <span class="keyword">teamwork and communication</span></li>

                                    </ul>
                                    <p>We took a lot of inspiration from PEAK, however, our USP is the <span class="keyword">emphasis on communication</span> within the submarine and the tasks needed to

                                            I was also in charge of the <span class='keyword'>development pipeline</span>, keeping track of our progress through <span class='keyword'>Jira</span> mainly. I led brief 
                                            <span class='keyword'>stand-up meetings</span> each morning to sync the team, identify <span class='keyword'>blockers</span>, and review progress against our <span class='keyword'>sprint goals</span>. If a 
                                            ticket didn't exist for someone's intended task, we would agree to create one before starting on it.<br><br>

                                            Midway through the project, I introduced a new <span class='keyword'>Jira column for priority</span> to reduce task confusion 
                                            and ensure the team always focused on the <span class='keyword'>most critical path items</span>. In the future, I would introduce this from the start,
                                            and I would have tickets be far more detailed.<br><br>

                                            The best practice we had was a <span class='keyword'>Discord channel called 'Task Updates'</span> where you say what you were working on throughout
                                            the day. This made it easier to track, but also to coordinate so two people wouldn't work on the same task by accident.

                                        For every game-critical action our logic runs exclusively on the server, keeping the <span class='keyword'>true state</span> 
                                        of the game world to prevent cheating (although it is co-op, so this isn't a huge deal).<br><br>

                                        We managed network traffic by using two methods for execution requests and visual synchronization (anything outside of Unreal's transform syncs).<br><br>

                                        <span class='keyword'>Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)</span> were used for <span class='keyword'>client input and requests</span>. A client would use an RPC (Runs on Server) call to

                                        <span class='keyword'>Replication Notifications (RepNotifies)</span> were used for broadcasting results. Once the server validated the RPC, it would update 
                                        a replicated property and the <span class='keyword'>OnRepNotify function</span> would trigger the resulting cosmetic or state effects (animation, audio, sometimes collision) on all clients.

                                    Our successful pivot was to treat the submarine not as a vehicle, but as a <span class="keyword">replicated Character class.</span> 
                                    Players enter the submarine by swapping their <span class="keyword">collision channels</span> upon entering. This clever workaround allowed us to leverage Unreal's 
                                    Character Movement Component (CMC) and its inherent <span class="keyword">client prediction</span> and <span class="keyword">net stability,</span> ensuring <span class="keyword">low bandwidth usage</span> and 
                                    reliable movement. Crucially, this stability let us retain the large window, a critical element for underwater exploration.

                                The player had several different states that needed differentiating between for certain circumstances. The main ones included:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Normal / Land</li>
                                    <li>Swimming</li>
                                    <li>Inside the Submarine</li>
                                    <li>Knocked / Unconscious</li>
                                    <li>Dead / Spectator</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Initially, I often encountered complex <span class="keyword">replication issues</span> on the client, particularly when using generic 
                                <span class="keyword">Server RPCs</span> called from different server-owned objects (such as triggers or overlaps).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With the help of a team programmer, we refined the approach, relying instead on updating replicated properties 
                                directly inside the <span class="keyword">Player or PlayerController</span> classes, using the associated <span class="keyword">RepNotifies</span> to consistently 
                                trigger state changes and visual effects on all clients. 
                            </p>

                                    <p>
                                        One good example of this is when entering the submarine, the player <span class="keyword">transitions from either swimming or normal mode to in the submarine.</span>
                                        It occurs when interacting with the submarine door, which <span class="keyword">teleports the player on the server,</span> before changing its collision type and <span class="keyword">movement
                                        mode in the RepNotify.</span> It is triggered by the door, but also by a volume inside the submarine in case of clipping or other glitches.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another example, as seen in the video above, is when a player <span class="keyword">loses all their health.</span> They become knocked and have a timer that counts down 
                                        before they die completely and move to spectator mode. Most of this is done in the <span class="keyword">PlayerController class as it should be local</span> changes that 
                                        they see (the player who died). However, there are <span class="keyword">replicated state variables</span> that allow other players to come and <span class="keyword">revive them</span> if they are knocked,
                                        for example.

                            When players were <span class="keyword">inside the submarine</span>, they experienced heavy movement jitter. We used <span class="keyword">Unreal Insights</span> to profile and 
                            test numerous builds, finding the root cause was <span class="keyword">net bandwidth spikes</span> due to mismatched replication rates on 
                            internal components. We also found the host's performance had a direct impact on the client's network experience.

                            The <span class="keyword">average FPS increased from 28 to 60,</span> and network bandwidth warnings stopped occurring in packaged builds.

                                    2. Lowered the parent Submarine Actor's overall Net Update Frequency to the minimum rate required for

                                    I used a <span class="keyword">Server RPC</span> called from the player's <span class="keyword">local PlayerController class</span> in order to make each interaction called on the server.
                                    Then, I could use <span class="keyword">RepNotifies or Multicasts</span> inside the interactable's class, depending on what was needed. An example is to the left.

                                        Originally we had oxygen and hunger as the two stats for the player, but quickly realized the <span class="keyword">hunger was pointless.</span> It slowed the player
                                        down in a way we didn't like, and it didn't feel connected to the oxygen. We also noticed the <span class="keyword">oxygen felt punishing</span> as you would die as soon
                                        as it hit zero.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Our solution was switching to an <span class="keyword">oxygen and health combo,</span> where health would determine being knocked out. Health also made more sense for the environmental
                                        enemies and hazards. To be less punishing when swimming, the <span class="keyword">oxygen could go to zero,</span> and only then you would start losing health.

                                    <p>
                                        I implemented these with <span class="keyword">actor components</span> that I attached to the player, each with their own functions to be called from other blueprints.

                                        We wanted the players to have a <span class="keyword">reason to go outside the submarine</span> more often, and we also thought it would be fun to guide 
                                        the players controlling it from the outside (like a person helping another park their car).

                                        I was excited about an 'oxygen cable' design I came up with, where the player could attach themselves to the submarine for <span class="keyword">infinite
                                        oxygen</span> and not get out of range. It made it so they could communicate with others at the front of the ship while being outside and having
                                        a <span class="keyword">better angled view</span> of the surrounding landscape.

                                        To simulate the realistic 'pull' back on the player, I utilized a <span class="keyword">cable component</span> to manage the attachment and set 
                                        the player's velocity accordingly when the length limit was reached. A programmer did the replication for this feature.

                                        For the player cleaning the algae from the propeller, I added the <span class="keyword">interactable interface</span> to make it simple and save time. I also added a function to
                                        <span class="keyword">damage and knockback</span> the player if the <span class="keyword">propeller hit</span> them while spinning.

                                This project was a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to grow significantly as a designer and developer. I gained 
                                valuable experience collaborating with various disciplines, how online multiplayer architecture functions, and methods for debugging and analyzing
                                network/optimization issues. I also improved my skills in Unreal Engine, particularly with Blueprints and some C++ implementation.
