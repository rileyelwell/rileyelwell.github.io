                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>
                    The Game Design Competition is my team's senior capstone project at Oregon State University. We are tasked with 
                    creating a driving simulator game with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Artificial Intelligence 
                    (AI) traffic, and realistic visual elements. 
                    
                    Our vision for this project is to simulate the food delivery robots that are Oregon State Unviersity's campus. They have their own sensors
                    and behaviors that we intend to simulate, and we plan to have AI vehicles and pedestrians as "obstacles." The main objective of the game will 
                    be to drive the robot in third-person view to deliver food to nearby customers in as little time as possible. Our main focus remains delivering
                    a realistic environment, accurate ADAS, and believable AI traffic.
                </p>
                
                <h1>My Role & The Process</h1>
                <p style="white-space: pre-line"> Project Type: Academic, Group
                    Project Role: Designer, Programmer, Artist
                    Software: Unity, Blender, Quixel Mixer
                    Languages: C#
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main role in this project is to develop the environment map for our robot vehicle to drive through. I am attempting to create an accurate 
                    representation of the Oregon State University campus, containing landmarks that locals and students are familiar with. Additionally, I am responsible
                    for designing the core gameplay loop and the mechanics the player-controlled robot will possess.
                    
                    This process has involved using Quixel Mixer and my own reference images for generating realistic textures. Then, I apply these texture
                    images to the models I have created in Blender and adjust their appearance by editing the UV maps. The models are almost 1:1 scale as I have been
                    utilizing the measurement features on Google Earth for accuracy, and the geometry is purposely low-poly to help prevent potential performance drops.

                    The core gameplay loop will be simple in principle, tasking the player with delivering a food order to a nearby customer. While pursuing this objective,
                    the player must avoid other vehicles and people, stay on their designated path, and achieve the goal as quickly as possible. The implemented
                    mechanics will also be fairly limited, but will include different movement abilities (such as a dash) to allow for more control over avoiding obstacles. 
                </p>

                <h1>What I Learned & What I Would Improve</h1>
                <p>
                    We still have until June to complete this project, but I've already gained valuable insights. I've significantly improved my skills with Blender, particularly 
                    in modeling, texturing, UV editing, and exporting. I now understand how to synthesize textures in different applications and edit them in Quixel Mixer. 
                    Learning about seamless textures, tiling, and techniques like adding noise and random rotations has helped minimize repetitive patterns on surfaces.

                    In Unity, I've learned about using mesh colliders on imported objects and their interactions with rigid bodies based on topology. I'm eager to continue 
                    exploring and learning throughout this project and to showcase the final product upon completion!
                </p>

                <h1>(Work in Progress) Screenshots</h1>
                <p>
                    This project is still currently under development and will not be fully finished until June 2024. Here are some current screenshots of some progress
                    I have made so far (mainly in Blender)!
