                "A Day in the Life of a Delivery Robot" was created as my senior capstone project at Oregon State University. Our team of four was tasked with developing a driving simulator, and we chose to let players control a robot delivering food orders on campus while navigating AI traffic and obstacles. The goal is to reach the delivery location on time while avoiding collisions. The project was directly inspired by the actual food delivery robots we had on the OSU campus during our time there. If you'd like to try a build of the game, check the links below.

                    <p>
                        My focus was creating an authentic representation of part of the Oregon State University campus, while making adjustments to fit and positively impact
                        the gameplay.

                    <p>
                        Since the map was based on a real-world location, I had a great reference but struggled with exact scaling. I utilized Google Earth and Google Maps a lot,
                        often using screenshots to trace rough outlines of buildings in Blender before adjusting the scale with notes I found online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were many obstacles, such as trash cans and signs, that made it difficult for the robot to maneuver, so I had to add these sparingly. Balancing these
                        with a reduced number of pedestrians was crucial to afford the player space and performance.

                      <p>
                        Working on the map alone, I quickly realized that only a section of the campus would be completed by our deadline, and I needed a solution for the bounds
                        of the area. I had ideas for using fog and invisible walls, or flat buildings to block the player, but went with surrounding fences and dirt fields as if
                        under construction.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As I was learning modeling, texturing, and 3D art in general for the first time, a lot of my models and textures were not optimal for performance. I tried to 
                        combat this with the use of static batching and less geometry in Blender, but my textures, compression, and collision generation skills need practice.

                            <p>One challenge I encountered while designing the level was determining how to handle the boundaries of the map. I tried several approaches:</p>

                                <li>
                                    <strong>Fog (Inspired by Silent Hill):</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Approach:</strong> I initially tried adding fog around the edges of the map.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Result:</strong> While it somewhat worked, it negatively impacted performance and didn't make sense within the narrative.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Buildings with Walls and Doors:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Approach:</strong> I placed buildings with walls and doors at the boundaries.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Result:</strong> This compromised the goal of creating a realistic campus and looked unappealing, with flat buildings acting as barriers.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Dirt Land Perimeter with Fence:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Approach:</strong> I added a large perimeter of dirt land around the map with a fence to block the player.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Result:</strong> This solution effectively stopped the player while maintaining a realistic appearance, as if that part of the campus was under construction or yet to be built. Performance was also unaffected due to static batching in Unity.</li>

Initially, I tried adding fog around the edges, similar to the Silent Hill series. While this somewhat worked, it negatively impacted performance and didn’t make much sense within the narrative. Next, I tried placing buildings with walls and doors at the boundaries, but this compromised the original goal of creating a realistic campus and looked unappealing with flat buildings acting as barriers. Eventually, I decided to add a large perimeter of dirt land around the entire map, with a fence blocking the player. This solution effectively stopped the player while also appearing somewhat realistic, as if that part of campus had yet to be built or was under construction. Additionally, performance was unaffected by this choice due to the use of static batching in Unity. You can see the overall finished map design above.

                                I am not primarily an artist and this was my first time 3D modeling on a larger scale, so I had to start by researching lots of tips and techniques. I found that artists often taken reference photos and since my goal was to recreate parts of our university campus, I started by capturing over a hundred images with my phone. Not only were these helpful for modeling, but they ended up being useful as textures later on (after modifications). I used Blender to model streets, buildings, and sidewalks, before applying seamless textures I created from my images inside Quixel Mixer and an online synthesis tool.

                            <p>The first thing I did for the UI was creating a mockup on paper for what I thought it should look like.

                                        <li>Avoid using the middle of the screen, using the tutorial for any information not needed at all times (ex: reset robot button).</li>

                                This game project was very involved, but it was very rewarding in the end, especially when showing it to family and peers. Working as a group of four students with other classes and jobs, we had little time to communicate and work effectively as a team. This was easily the hardest part for me, but I think our goal of developing a fun and short game was successful in the end.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In terms of technical knowledge, I significantly improved my skills with Blender, particularly in modeling, texturing, UV editing, and exporting. I now understand how to synthesize textures in different applications and edit them in Quixel Mixer. Also, learning about seamless textures, tiling, and techniques like adding noise and random rotations has helped minimize repetitive patterns on my created surfaces. In Unity, I learned about using mesh colliders on imported objects and their interactions with rigid bodies based on topology. I improved my programming skills in C#, became better at testing features that need to be balanced (partly through conducting playtests), and learned how to do lighting. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Overall, I think there are a lot of necessary improvements for this project if it were to be revisited in the future. With our time crunch and poor communication habits, the final version of the game has several large bugs and poor performance. Features added towards the end did not have enough time to be properly tested, the map has a couple of collision issues, and the difficulty was harder than intended. With more time, better planning, and an in-sync team, I would love to implement a larger map, a better physics system, fix bugs, balance more appropriately, and adjust scenes for better performance.
