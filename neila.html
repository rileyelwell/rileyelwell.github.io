                                Inspired by Control, I felt that telekinesis as a core player ability was perfect for a combat-sandbox type game.
                                It offers <span class="keyword">extensive freedom, enabling interaction with entities and the environment,</span> causing destruction, and solving puzzles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My prototype focused on replicating Control's "Pull" ability's feel. While the <span class="keyword">core logic was in Blueprints,</span> I discussed
                                with a programmer about implementing custom C++ nodes for optimization later on.

                                    For a <span class="keyword">third-person perspective,</span> the crosshair was not aligned with the camera's forward vector. Therefore, 
                                    I utilized a <span class="keyword">line trace along a specific channel,</span> originating from the screen location of the crosshair 
                                    and extending a reachable distance in front of the player.

                                    Since combat can be chaotic, if no object was directly within the player's crosshair, I 
                                    implemented a <span class="keyword">secondary sphere trace to detect any nearby objects around the player</span> that were not

                                    The nearest detected object would always be stored in a <span class="keyword">reference variable</span> with a <span class="keyword">post-process

                                    When the player activates telekinesis with a valid object, it is attached to a <span class="keyword">physics handle</span> on the player. 
                                    While this handles much of the <span class="keyword">position updating,</span> collaborating with another designer and programmer allowed us to add

                                    To denote objects that were pullable, I made an <span class="keyword">actor component</span> you could <span class="keyword">easily attach to any static mesh</span> in the level.
                                    It would automatically set the correct variables and channels needed, but also had <span class="keyword">adjustable values for different behaviors.</span>

                                    When using the physics handle, I wanted to give players more <span class="keyword">control</span> and <span class="keyword">responsiveness</span> over held objects. 
                                    I started by implementing a system where the object would <span class="keyword">rotate with the camera's pitch,</span> allowing it to 
                                    follow the player's gaze when looking up or down.

                                <p>
                                    This enhancement helped players <span class="keyword">stack objects using telekinesis.</span> Additionally, I added an <span class="keyword">adjustable 
                                    offset for the physics handle</span> to control the distance of objects from the player. This prevented 
                                    objects from colliding with the player or going off-screen, improving the overall feel.

                                    I attempted to implement a system to update the physics handle's location when encountering walls, 
                                    aiming to keep the object consistently in view. However, this led to issues with items <span class="keyword">clipping 
                                    through walls</span> or becoming <span class="keyword">permanently stuck.</span> As a result, we later decided to simply <span class="keyword">drop 
                                    the object</span> if it moved too far from the player.

                                    To give players a sense of <span class="keyword">control and power,</span> I designed launched objects to have a

                                    object's behavior was determined by its assigned <span class="keyword">enum</span> in the actor component, allowing for 
                                    actions like <span class="keyword">sticking, destroying/exploding, bouncing, etc.</span>

                                    The <span class="keyword">third-person perspective</span> presented challenges for aiming. I initially used a line trace from 
                                    the held object's location to where a secondary, extended crosshair line trace would hit. 
                                    Since this wasn't a direct line to the crosshair (like a camera's forward vector would provide), 
                                    <span class="keyword">accuracy often felt off.</span>

                                    Later in the project, working with a programmer, I designed and he implemented a solution using a 
                                    <span class="keyword">larger sphere trace</span> to detect objects, rather than a thin line trace. While this improved accuracy, 
                                    I aim to refine this system further in the future. Control locks on targets and I prototyped this too, but I decided against this to keep 
                                    the theme of <span class="keyword">freedom for the player.</span>

                                Neila's diverse movement, especially when using telekinesis, required careful animation management. 
                                To keep her animations <span class="keyword">structured and consistent,</span> I built <span class="keyword">two separate blend spaces</span> and a <span class="keyword">state 
                                machine</span> within the <span class="keyword">animation blueprint.</span> During telekinesis, I track the player's movement direction 
                                and speed to ensure a proper blend between the different animations.

                                    As the player's captors, Scientists were designed for building <span class="keyword">tension</span> and showcasing <span class="keyword">strength.</span>
                                    Using a <span class="keyword">behavior tree</span> for the first time, I began the design with a slow, menacing walk culminating in a 
                                    powerful <span class="keyword">slam attack</span> with knockback.

                                <p>
                                    Collaborating with artists, we gave them a <span class="keyword">steam engine weakpoint</span> on their back for significant damage. To make it possible to reach, 
                                    I enabled the player to <span class="keyword">stun Scientists with their telekinesis.</span>
                                </p>

                                    I initially experimented with the weakpoint being the only way to damage the Scientists, and stuns dealt 
                                    no direct damage. However, this approach led to overwhelming feedback about <span class="keyword">difficulty and frustration.</span> So, 
                                    I revised it to include a <span class="keyword">damaging stun</span> while upgrading the <span class="keyword">weakpoint to be a one-shot.</span>

                                    To balance their slow movement with their threat level, I gave them a <span class="keyword">beam attack that pulls the player.</span> 
                                    Early playtesting showed that an auto-latching beam was too frustrating. To make it more avoidable, 
                                    I designed a version with a <span class="keyword">charge-up period,</span> a moving beam that <span class="keyword">sweeps in a radius</span> towards the player, 
                                    and the ability to <span class="keyword">cancel the attack with stuns.</span>

                                        enemy spawner.</span> This approach offered better <span class="keyword">performance</span> and greater <span class="keyword">adaptability</span> in the long run.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For example, I'd planned a <span class="keyword">dramatic, almost jump-scare-like first encounter</span> with the Scientist, 
                                        where they'd burst through a door. But this coincided with players unlocking the "glue" ability, 
                                        leading to players <span class="keyword">overlooking the new mechanic.</span> To allow players time to learn their new 
                                        ability, I <span class="keyword">redesigned the encounter.</span> Now, the door can only be unlocked by the player's glue ability, and 
                                        the Scientist spawns once the player opens the door.
                                    </p>

                            <p>Working with a larger team for a shorter period of time can have its difficulties, but we did a good job of creating
                                a strong core from the beginning that we stuck with throughout the project. We took feedback in stride and adjusted 
                                when needed. I learned a lot of technical knowledge about UE5, behavior trees, implementing animations, and prototyping
                                blueprints that were readable and usable for other disciplines. However, I also learned a great deal about target audiences,
                                marketing strategies, conducting playtests, delivering staged builds (pre-alpha, alpha, beta, etc.), and working with
                                project managers. This project was a great experience and I hope to continue improving it and upon myself going forward.
