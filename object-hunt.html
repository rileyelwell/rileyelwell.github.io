                <h1>Overall Description</h1>
                <p>
                    Object Hunt is an interactive two-player mobile game that challenges players to find objects based on their name and location is an engaging and thrilling experience. The 
                    objective is to be the first player to locate the object and take its picture while being in the correct geographic location, adding an exciting element 
                    of strategy and real-world exploration to the gameplay. Each successful capture earns a point, fostering a sense of competition and achievement, and the 
                    game continues until all objects in the submitted queue have been found, ensuring a dynamic and satisfying gaming experience.

                <h1>My Role & The Process</h1>
                <p style="white-space: pre-line"> Project Type: Academic, Group
                    Role: Designer, Programmer
                    Software: Android Studio
                    Languages: Kotlin, JS
                </p>
                <p>
                    I collaborated with three classmates to conceptualize the gameplay loop for our project, settling on a multiplayer scavenger hunt. This assignment, part of 
                    our Mobile App Development course, had a unique requirement: the incorporation of an API into our application's design. Object Hunt is built on a custom 
                    Node.js framework for the backend, utilizes Socket.IO for multiplayer functionality, and leverages Android ML Kit and Google's Maps and Vision APIs for 
                    game features. My specific contribution involved integrating Google's Maps API for live location sharing and the placement of markers to pinpoint objects. 
                    I also played a key role in developing the custom backend that controlled various screen functionalities. Our combined efforts resulted in a polished 
                    final product, earning us the esteemed Hall of Fame recognition from our professor!
                </p>

                <h1>What I Learned & What I Would Improve</h1>
                <p>
                    Working in a group of four was an excellent way to learn about mobile app development and APIs, while also honing collaboration skills. My role required 
                    extensive research on Google's Maps API, offering me valuable insights into API functionality and practical use. Throughout the project, I gained hands-on 
                    experience with Android Studio, collaborated effectively using Git/GitHub, and successfully built a mobile application (APK).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If given additional time or the opportunity to revisit our design, we would focus on expanding the game's features and functionality. This might involve 
                    adding a wider variety of objects, increasing flexibility in map locations, and implementing a high-score saving system. The core gameplay loop in the final 
                    product met our initial objectives, and these enhancements would aim to further enrich the already-established user experience. 
                </p>
