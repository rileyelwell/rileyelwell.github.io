                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>
                    During my Computer Graphics Shaders course at Oregon State University, I was not only exposed to the foundational principles of computer graphics but also 
                    had the exciting opportunity to explore its applications in the real world. As the course progressed, I became fascinated with the creative 
                    possibilities that shaders offered, and I was eager to apply my newfound knowledge to a unique project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the final assignment of the course, we were encouraged to push the boundaries of our shader programming skills by selecting a shader type that wasn't 
                    explicitly covered in the curriculum. After conducting thorough research and contemplating various options, I was drawn to the idea of creating a realistic 
                    grass shader. The decision was inspired by my appreciation for the natural world, the desire to simulate it in a virtual environment, and its connection
                    to the game development space. Grass, with its intricate details, complex interaction with light, and the way it sways in the wind, presented a compelling 
                    challenge for a shader project.
                </p>
                
                <h1>My Role & The Process</h1>
                <p style="white-space: pre-line"> Project Type: Academic, Solo
                    Role: Programmer
                    Software: Visual Studio
                    Languages: OpenGL/GLSL, C++
                </p>
                <p>
                    The grass was initially created by generating an array of points, which were then processed through shaders to create billboards ("Billboarding") for the 
                    grass. A grass texture was applied to these billboards along with lighting. To enhance realism, three billboards were used, each rotated in 3D space and 
                    randomized along the y-axis. To simulate natural color variation, a technique called Fractal Brownian Motion was employed with a noise texture. This color 
                    randomness was introduced to the grass to give a more natural look. Different grass blade heights were achieved using a custom random function in shaders, 
                    adjusting each quad's height for variation while avoiding extremes. Lastly, wind effects were added by using noise textures and variables to define wind 
                    direction and strength. The wind was applied to the top portion of the grass quads by roataintg the vector, and this created a realistic movement effect.
                    
                    I kicked off this project by delving into research on established methods for crafting realistic grass shaders, and I aimed to adapt these techniques 
                    for use with OpenGL and GLSL. 
                </p>

                <h1>What I Learned & What I Would Improve</h1>
                <p>
                    I had a limited window of approximately two weeks to delve into shading techniques and apply them to my simulation. Initially, I encountered methods that were 
                    primarily designed for various game engines or reliant on plugins incompatible with OpenGL. Nevertheless, through persistent exploration, I unearthed valuable 
                    insights, such as the utilization of Fractal Brownian Motion, billboarding, and the incorporation of noise textures. While industry-standard game engines and 
                    other software may employ more efficient methods, these techniques collectively equipped me with a foundational understanding of shading (especially in terms of
                    video game implementation), offering a means to enhance performance without compromising quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With additional time and greater flexibility in the project requirements, my aim would be to master the art of crafting a highly realistic grass shader within 
                    Unreal Engine 5. My specific goals would encompass refining the wind effects to introduce more randomized and lifelike movements, precisely defining the height 
                    of the grass blades, and elevating the overall quality of textures and graphics for the grass. Leveraging Unreal Engine's extensive capabilities and plugins, 
                    I'd strive to create a shader of such exceptional quality that it could potentially find application in a professional video game product, pushing the 
                    boundaries of visual realism and immersion.
                </p>
